&nbsp;Since the U4EA web site is so new, and technically speaking designing web sites is not my full
time job, there are only a few web sites I’ve designed for you to see. It is my fondest wish though,
that in the near future, to expand my clientele base as much as possible and to become a full time web
site designer. For that reason alone, at this time I am offering to design the first five web sites free
of charge. :) My goal is to add your site to my online digital portfolio so that any perspective employers,
who might want to hire me, can see for themselves the kind  of work that I’m capable of doing. As you’ll
see for yourself, I think that I’m quite skilled and knowledgeable in what it takes to achieve a distinct
and professional appearance on the web. Whether it’s you, your organization or even your small business,
I’d like to ask that you give me a chance to consult with you, to see if we can both work out something
mutually beneficial. Thank you again for taking the time to view my work and to visit my web site.

<br>

Have fun,&nbsp; -u4ea-&nbsp;  :)

&nbsp;This site is a tribute to an extremely awesome automobile GM made in partnership with Pinifirina. 
One of the true classics even after all of these years, a testimony to the design and craftsmanship
of a legendary automobile.
